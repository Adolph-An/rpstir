# If a ROA at one point had a trust chain back to a trust anchor
# validating it, but then later lost this trust chain due to a
# certificate expiring or being revoked by a CRL, then the ROA is
# in a validation stale state.
# Specifying no means that all such ROAs are eliminated from the output,
# while yes treats all such ROAs as equivalent to valid ROAs.
#RPKIAllowStaleValidationChain no

# If a ROA or any certificate on its trust chain has never been on a
# valid manifest, then there is reason to consider the ROA suspect.
# Specifying no means that all such ROAs are eliminated from the output,
# while yes treats all such ROAs as equivalent to valid ROAs.
#RPKIAllowNoManifest yes

# If a CRL is stale, i.e. the current time is past its next update time,
# and a more recent replacement CRL has not arrived, then all the
# certificates in the scope of this CRL and their descendants are suspect.
# Specifying no eliminates all such objects, while yes allows them
# into the output (essentially ignoring this type of staleness).
#RPKIAllowStaleCRL yes

# In the same way that a CRL can be stale, so can a manifest, which makes
# all the certificates in its scope and their descendants stale.
# Specifying no eliminates all such objects, while yes allows them
# into the output (essentially ignoring this type of staleness).
#RPKIAllowStaleManifest yes

# Certificate can be added that have not yet become valid. Yes includes
# these certificates, no excludes them.

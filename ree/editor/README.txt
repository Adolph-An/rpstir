This installation requires gmake.

If you are running the RuleEditor and it fails with an error stating
that it cannot find libstdc++.so.5 and you have a later version, you
must make a symlink between that later version and the .5 version. If
you only have earlier versions then you must install the .5 version
for the RuleEditor to work.

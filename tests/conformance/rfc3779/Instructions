           Instructions for use of Test Cases

    The test cases consist of files with suffixes ".cer" and ".raw", where a
".cer" file is a certificate and a ".raw" file is a human readable version of 
the corresponding ".cer" file.  File names consist of one or more letters 
followed by the number of the test case described in the README document.  The 
prefix letters are "P", "C", "GC"and "GGC".  There are also files suffixed with
"p15" which contain signing keys.

    To run the tests, first execute the python program creat_cert.py, which 
generates new ".cer" files with refreshed beginning and end dates.  Then execute the python program run_tests.py, which runs all the tests, stopping at the 
first error encountered.

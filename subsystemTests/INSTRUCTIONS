(1) Open two shell windows.
(2) Before each test (but not before each step in a a test), run initDB in one of the windows.
(3) In the same window, run doLoader and leave it running for the duration of the test.
(4) In the other window, execute the files corresponding to each step of the test in the correct order.
(5) For each step where there is an indicated number of expected results, count to make sure that the right number are printed.

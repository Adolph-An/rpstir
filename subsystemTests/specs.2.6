# This file serves as a model of how to specify which ROAs to keep and
#      which to reject based on different ways of not being perfect
# Note that any that have never been validated at some point with a trust
#      chain to a trust anchor are automatically eliminated
# "yes" means to accept the ROA anyway, and "no" means to reject it
#      default is yes

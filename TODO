 * run "make install DESTDIR=/path/to/tempdir" and see if everything gets installed in places that make sense
 * rename installed files that might cause conflicts or confusion (e.g. by putting "dump" in $PATH)
 * run "make distcheck"
 * setup a VM, run "make install", and see if it works (i.e. test as much functionality as possible)
 * buildbot changes?
 * update INSTRUCTIONS.in
  * copy etc/test.conf to ~/.@PACKAGE_NAME@.test.conf before "make check"
  * if you install to a non-standard location, add $(bindir) to your $PATH
  * use generic make instead of gmake (after testing on BSD make)

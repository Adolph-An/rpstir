 * fix circular dependency with logutils (libutil.a), libconfig.a, and libconfiglib.a
 * run "make install DESTDIR=/path/to/tempdir" and see if everything gets installed in places that make sense
 * run "make distcheck"
 * setup a VM, run "make install", and see if it works (i.e. test as much functionality as possible)
 * update INSTRUCTIONS.in
  * copy etc/test.conf to ~/.@PACKAGE_NAME@.test.conf before "make check"

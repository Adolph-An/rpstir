WARNING: This library IS NOT designed to provide any security against malicious
config files. Some care is taken to avoid buffer overflows and other similar
attacks, but there is NO GUARANTEE that an attacker with access to configuration
file(s) can't gain the privileges of the user parsing the config file with this
library.

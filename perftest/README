        Performance Test Data Structure and Programs

    The performance test data structure consists of four levels of files.  At 
the top level there is only one certificate file, C.cer.  At the next level, 
but in the same directory, are several files of certificates issued by C.cer,
named C1.cer, C2.cer, etc.  For each such certificate there is also a directory
which contains all certificates (both CA and end-entity), CRLs, ROAs and
manifests issued (and therefore signed) by that CA.  For example, there is a 
directory named C1 containing a ROA named R1.roa, a manifest named M1.man,
the end-entity certificates C1R.cer and C1M.cer of the signers of R1.roa and
M1.man respectively, plus a CRL issued by C1 called L1.crl.  This directory 
also contains CA certificates named C1.00001.cer, C1.00002.cer, etc.  For each 
of these CA certificates there is a directory named C1.00001, C1,00002, etc.  
In these directories is yet another collection of end-entity certificates, CRLs,
ROAs and manifests plus CA certificates for the level below.  The structure is,
therefore, like this:

C.cer -- C1.cer
         C1 ---- C1R.cer
                 C1M.cer
                 L1.crl
                 R1.roa
                 M1.man
                 C1.00001,cer
                 C1.00001 ----C1.00001R.cer
                              C1.00001M.cer
                              L1.00001.crl
                              R1.00001.roa
                              M1.00001.man
                              C1.00001.001.cer
                              C1.00001.001 --- C1.00001.001R.cer
                                               C1.00001.001M.cer
                                               L1.00001.001.crl
                                               R1.00001.001.roa
                                               M1.00001.001.man
                              C1.00001.002 -- C1.00001.002R.cer etc.

                 C1.00002.cer
                 C1.00002 --- C1.00002R.cer  etc.
         C2 --- C2R.cer etc.

where C.cer and all its signees are actually in the same directory.

    These files are generated automatically with scripts and programs using a 
single signing key pair called C1.p15 located in the top directory.  The 
contents of the C1, C2,... directories are created by running a script which
goes down one directory and runs make_perf_cert to create the two end-
entity certificates, the CRL and the 10,000 certificates for the next level.
The script also runs make_perf_roa and make_perf_manifest to create the 
necessary ROA and manifest.  Then the script goes down one level to do the
same for each of the 10,000 CAs just created, making their material.  At each
of these CAs, the script goes down again another level to make the CRLs and
end entity certificates for each of those CAs.

How to run the tests:

(1) Open two windows.

(2) Set the environment variables APKI_DB, APKI_ROOT and APKI_PORT in both windows (or alternatively in your startup file).
APKI_DB = database name (e.g., davestestdb)
APKI_ROOT = pathname of top of tree (e.g., /home/dmontana/apki)
APKI_PORT = port number (e.g., 7000)

(3) In one window, execute the script initDB and then the script listener.  You will have to enter the root mysql password twice for initDB.

(4) In the other window, execute the tests (runTest1, runTest2, etc.) in numerical order.

How to run the tests:

(1) Open two windows.

(2) Set the environment variables RPKI_DB, RPKI_ROOT and RPKI_PORT in
both windows (or alternatively in your startup file).

RPKI_DB = database name (e.g., davestestdb)
RPKI_ROOT = pathname of top of tree (e.g., /home/dmontana/apki)
RPKI_PORT = port number (e.g., 7000)

(3) In one window, execute the script initDB and then the script
listener.  You will have to enter the root mysql password twice for
initDB.

(4) In the other window, execute the tests (runTest1, runTest2, etc.)
in numerical order.

(5) There will be indications of the expected numbers of outputs
followed by the outputs.  The tester should just make sure that these
match.

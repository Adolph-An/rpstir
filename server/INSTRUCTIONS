This directory contains an implementation of the RPKI-RTR server
specifications given in the document "The RPKI/Router Protocol" at
http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ymbk-rpki-rtr-protocol-04.txt
It also contains an implementation of a sample client, but this client
only prints out the data received; a real client would add this data
to the router.

On the server side, there are two applications to execute:
(1) doUpdate - This application is executed as part of the standard
cycle of operations performed at a local cache.

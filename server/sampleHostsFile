# Example of a specification of the servers for a client
# 
# Each non-comment line (i.e., not blank and not starting with '#')
#   specifies a single server to which the client can connect.
# The servers are specified in order of descending priority, with the
#   highest priority server first.
# Each line contains up to four fields with the defaults in square brackets:
#   hostname username[=rpkirtr] standalone[=no] port[=22]
#     hostname is where the server lives
#     username is the name of the user account on the server to which to ssh
#     standalone is whether the client is standalone or uses the SSH client
#     port is the SSH port to connect to at the host

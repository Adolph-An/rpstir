# Example of a specification of the servers for a client
# 
# Each non-comment line (i.e., not starting with '#') specifies a single
#   server to which the client can connect.
# The servers are specified in order of descending priority, with the
#   highest priority server first.
# Each line contains up to three fields with the defaults in square brackets:
#   hostname[=localhost] standalone[=no] port[=22] user[=<current user>]
#     hostname is where the server lives
#     standalone is whether the client is standalone or uses the SSH client
#     port is the SSH port to connect to at the host
#     user is the user name to use for ssh (eventually switch to key pairs)

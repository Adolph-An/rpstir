this verify is including checks on certificates such as EE certs
containing digitalSignature as the being the only bit set to true.

For CA's only the keyCertSign and CRLSign bits should be set to true.

make generic

should build the sample program ./verify_stub_test

run it with the argument of 2.cer.pem and it should work.

OBNotes: I need to check and test it against different chains of
know working certs etc. (longer chains primarily)

The following are the steps required to run the APKI software.  Note that
steps 1-4 only need to be executed once at the beginning if everything goes
completely as planned.  Steps 5-8 have to be run periodically even under
ideal circumstances.  It is recommended that the user create a script
to run these four steps and have a cron job that executes this script
periodically.

(1) make the executables: In this directory, execute make, and this should
    create all the required executables in all the different directories.

(2) set environment variables: There are three environment variables used
    throughout the scripts and the code:
    APKI_DB - the name of the MySQL database used to hold the APKI data
    APKI_PORT - the port number used for the loader and feeder to talk
    APKI_ROOT - the full pathname of this directory (the top-level
      directory of the APKI tree)
    These environment variables will be set automatically to the
    following defaults by each of the scripts in the run_scripts directory:
    APKI_DB = apki
    APKI_PORT = 7344
    APKI_ROOT = current working directory, or one higher if in
                directory run_scripts
    If you ever want to run the code directly instead of running the
    scripts, make sure to set these yourself.

(3) initDB: This script deletes the database, if any, with the name
    APKI_DB and sets up a new database with all the right tables.
    Be prepared to enter the root MySQL password twice.

(4) loader: This starts the process that receives data from the feeder
    and loads it into the database.  Under ideal circumstances, this will
    continue to run forever, waiting for inputs from the feeder.

(5) rsync_pull and feeder

(6) garbage collector

(7) chaser

(8) query

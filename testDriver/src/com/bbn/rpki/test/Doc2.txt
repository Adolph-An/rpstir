RPKI Test Framework

The RPKI test framework has two relatively independent parts: The
first is building a model of the RP hierarchy including the artifacts
(certs, roas, etc.) of the nodes over time based on the depth of the
hierarchy, its fan out characteristics, and how it should evolve over
time. The second is an emulation of the operation of the overall
system including the upload of artifacts to rsync repositories and the
updating of the cache.

The model building part is reasonably straightforward and is adapted
from the testbed_create python script by introducing evolution over
time.

The second part emulates the operation of the various relying parties
including their autonomy, inter-dependence, and eventually their
misbehavior. The basic steps of uploading the artifacts of the model
to repositories and updating the cache can be broken down into
independent activities corresponding to the independent nodes of the
model and the independent steps within a node that may either be
performed in parallel or in an arbitrary order. Further breakdown
allows for emulating the operational dynamics of computers and
networks such upload failure, updating in the middle of an upload.
The ways in which the steps can be broken down is explicitly
represented allowing the granularity of the breakdown to be varied.

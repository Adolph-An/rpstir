Activity

An Activity is generally a series of primitive activities performed in
sequence, in parallel, or iteratively. Each primitive activity
performs a task as described by a TaskDescription. Arguments described
by the TaskDescription are supplied by the primitive activity from a
parameter stream or from the outputs of earlier activities.

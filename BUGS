This file contains descriptions of known bugs that could significantly affect
the use of rpstir.


Single validation path:

    If there is more than one path from an RPKI object to a trust anchor, only
    one of these paths is currently checked. It might be possible for a
    malicious CA to exploit this by re-signing and publishing a copy of another
    CA's certificate. This would create an additional (invalid) path to the
    target's children, which could cause rpstir to consider those children
    invalid even though the correct path from them to a TA is valid.


Object deletion:

    If an object is removed from a remote repository, it gets removed from
    rpstir's cache the next time the cache is synchronized with the remote
    repository. This allows a malicious repository maintainer or monkey-in-the-
    middle who does not have access to a Certification Authority's private key
    to remove objects that are valid and not revoked.

This file contains descriptions of known bugs that could significantly affect
the use of rpstir.


Single validation path:

    If there is more than one path from an RPKI object to a trust anchor, only
    one of these paths is currently checked. TODO: explain why this is bad.


Object deletion:

    If an object is removed from a remote repository, it gets removed from
    rpstir's cache the next time the cache is synchronized with the remote
    repository. This allows a malicious repository maintainer or monkey-in-the-
    middle who does not have access to a Certification Authority's private key
    to remove objects that are valid and not revoked.

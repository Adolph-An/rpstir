This file contains descriptions of known bugs in RPSTIR.  The BBN
RPSTIR software team advises waiting for patches to these issues
before deploying RPSTIR in a production environment.


Single validation path:

    If there is more than one path from an RPKI object to a trust
    anchor, then in certain non-standard situations (traversing the
    RPKI hierarchy out-of-order), only one of these paths is currently
    checked. It might be possible for a malicious CA to exploit this
    by re-signing and publishing a copy of another CA's
    certificate. This would create an additional (invalid) path to the
    target's children, which may cause rpstir to consider those
    children invalid even though the correct path from them to a TA is
    valid.  We expect to resolve this issue in a future release.


Object deletion:

    If an object is removed from a remote repository, it gets removed
    from rpstir's cache the next time the cache is synchronized with
    the remote repository. This allows a malicious repository
    maintainer or man-in-the-middle who does not have access to a
    Certification Authority's private key to remove objects that are
    valid and not revoked.  We expect a feature in a future release
    that detects when an unauthenticated deletion has occurred.  In
    further future releases, we expect to improve our cache to store
    these files and continue to use them for as long as they are
    considered valid.

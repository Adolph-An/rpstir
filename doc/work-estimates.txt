ASN.1
  Look at other libraries and determine their usability (do this before schema): 24
  If there's a good candidate library
    Possibly do this before schema
      Activate new library (to use both old and new libraries): 8
      Write conversion function between each libraries structs: 40
    For each function that uses ASN.1
      Modify function, using conversion function when calling unmodified subroutines: 160
      If no test exists, write unit test: 160
  If there's no good candidate library
    If we don't give up
      Redesign casn API: 80
      Implement new API separately from old API: 240
      Rewrite portions at a time using the same strategy as above: <same>

Parallel Rsync (depends on schema and config)
  Design: 8
  Code: 80
  (Testing is counted in DoS Countermeasures for bad tests and Testbed for good tests)

Gray Areas (spec isn't ready)

Key Rollover (depends on Testbed)
  Test:  4
  Fixes: 24

Algorithm Agility, 1st Phase (targetting RSA-1024/MD5 but supporting
  only existing algorithms, depends on config)
  - Simulation of 'RP Ready Algorithm B Date' requires a significant
  amount of planning. (no estimate at this point in time)

OpenSSL / Cryptlib (depends on schema)
  Reduce dependencies on OpenSSL as part of DB schema
  implementation. (no separate estimate needed)

Refactoring (exlusive)
  Goal: installable software, reduce code duplication, uniform style
  Requirements: no other concurrent work and no significant outstanding branches
  Time estimate: 64

Compile Warnings (weak depends on refactoring)
  Goal: have no compile warnings on any of our supported platforms and add -Werror (turning warnings into errors)
  Dependency: this would be easiest right after refactoring, but could be done at any time
  Time estimate: 40

Debian Package (depends on refactoring)
  Package OpenSSL+3779: 16
  Package cryptlib: 16
  Make package: 8

NAME
        add_key_info - adds or replaces subject key information and 
          (optionally) authority key information extensions

SYNOPSIS   

        add_key_info subjectcertfile subjectkeyfile [authoritycertfile]

DESCRIPTION

        This program modifies the subjectcertfile adding or replacing the 
        extensions for subject and authority key identifiers.  The
        authoritykeyfile parameter must be present if the certificate's subject
        and issuer names differ.  If they differ, the program gives the 
        authority key identifier the same value as the subject key identifier.  
        The subjectkeyfile must be a key file of type ".p15" with label "label"
        and password "password".

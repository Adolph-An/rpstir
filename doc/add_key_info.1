.TH ADD_KEY_INFO 1 "2010 Feb 18" "ASN.1 Tools" "ROA-PKI"

.SH NAME
add_key_info \- adds or replaces the Subject Public Key Info,
Subject Key Identifier and Authority Key Identifier extensions of an
X.509 certificate

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B add_key_info
.I subjectcertfile subjectkeyfile [authoritycertfile]

.SH DESCRIPTION

This program modifies 
.I subjectcertfile
by adding or replacing the extensions for Subject Public Key Info,
Subject Key Identifier (SKI), and Authority Key Identifier (AKI).  The
SKI/AKI are defined as the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value of the
DER-encoded ASN.1 bit string of the subject/issuer's public key,
respectively.  The key file,
.IR subjectkeyfile ,
must of type ".p15" with label "label" and password "password",
as generated by
.BR gen_key (1).

Note that any modifications to the certificate, such as those made by 
.BR add_key_info ,
will invalidate the certificate's current signature.  As a corollary,
any time you run
.BR add_key_info ,
you must later run
.BR sign_cert (1).

There are two modes: one for a self-signed certificate, and one for a
subordinate certificate.  Both modes add/replace the Subject Public Key Info
extension of
.I subjectcertfile
with the key information in
.IR subjectkeyfile .
The behavior with respect to AKI, however, differs as explained below.

.SS Self-Signed Certificate
By definition, a self-signed certificate has no
.IR authoritycertfile .
The extra command line parameter must not be present, and the subject
and issuer names of
.I subjectcertfile
must be identical.  The SKI and AKI fields are identically filled in
by computing the SHA-1 hash of the public key in
.IR subjectkeyfile .

.SS Subordinate Certificate
If
.I subjectcertfile
is a subordinate certificate, then its subject and issuer names must
differ and the
.I authoritycertfile
parameter must be present.  The SKI field is filled in by
computing the SHA-1 hash of the public key in
.IR subjectkeyfile ,
and the AKI field is filled in by copying the SKI field of
.I authoritycertfile.

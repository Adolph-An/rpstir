Parallel rsync is the rpstir component that fetches data from rsync URIs.

= Top-level Requirements =

1. Security. Remote repositories are not trusted and should not be allowed to take up too much local resources, interfere with other remote repositories, or gain access to the local system.

2. Speed. Updating the local cache from all repositories should happen as quickly as reasonably possible.

3. Durability. A failed download or system crash should be recoverable.

4. Correctness. Files should be downloaded from the specified URIs, not randomly filled with verses from Shakespeare's less well-known works. Monkeys on typewriters are right out.


= Derived Requirements =

1. (T1, T2, and T4) Concurrency. Multiple downloads should happen in parallel so one slow download doesn't slow down the entire fetch process or prevent any subsequent fetches from running.

2. (T2 and T3) Partial recovery. Only tasks that were in progress during a crash should need to be recovered; recovery should not require re-downloading everything from all remote repositories.

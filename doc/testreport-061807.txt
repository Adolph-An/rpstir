In this test, the testers were asked to not report on minor errors
that had been encountered previously.  As a result, only "major"
errors will be the subject of this report.

In certificate testing, a number of certificates were inappropriately
recognized as valid. These included the following test cases:
3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.2 4.4 4.7 and 4.8. The issue with test case
3.2 was previously discovered to be a bug in the OpenSSL library. The
issue with test case 3.6 was discovered to be a bug in the test data.
All other test cases listed above appear to be due to the introduction
of the "delayed verification" algorithm, in which a certificate is
first verified for syntactic content and then later for semantic content.
The second verification step requires the parent certificate. In addition
certain conditions which could, potentially, be discovered in the syntactic
phase (such as an expired certificate) are deferred to the semantic phase.
This algorithm was introduced between the first unit test and the present
unit test, which would appear to account for the differnce in test results.

A final problem was that test case 3.5 gave an "out of memory" error (not
a date error as would be expected). This was traced to a bug in date handling
which has since been resolved.

All CRL tests passed.

All ROA tests passed.

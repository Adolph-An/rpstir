General guide to bad certs:

Type 1: Missing Fields
  Null file
  Critical bits not set

Type 2: Extra/Duplicate Fields
  Various repeated fields, some the same, some different
  Critical bits set where they are not supposed to be

Type 3: Corrupted/bad Fields
  oid's incorrect
  Bad signatures
  Bad IP addresses
  Bad AS numbers
  Invalid dates

Type 4: Out of Order Fields
  IP addresses not in order
  AS numbers not in order

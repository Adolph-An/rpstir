ASN.1
  Look at other libraries and determine their usability (do this before schema): 8
  If there's a good candidate library
    Possibly do this before schema
      Activate new library (to use both old and new libraries): 1
      Write conversion function between each libraries structs: 40
    For each function that uses ASN.1
      Modify function, using conversion function when calling unmodified subroutines: 80
      If no test exists, write unit test: 80
  If there's no good candidate library
    If we don't give up
      Redesign casn API: 40
      Implement new API separately from old API: 160
      Rewrite portions at a time using the same strategy as above: 1 + 40 + 80 + 80 = 201

Key Rollover (depends on Testbed)
  Test: 8
  Fixes: 16

Algorithm Agility, 1st Phase (targetting RSA-1024/MD5 but supporting only existing algorithms, depends on config)
  Make repo with both old and "new" algorithms: 8
  Add config item for list of algorithms to silently ignore: 2
  Test: 4

OpenSSL / Cryptlib (depends on schema)
  Reduce dependencies on OpenSSL as part of DB schema implementation. (no estimate needed)

Refactoring (exlusive)
  Goal: installable software, reduce code duplication, uniform style
  Requirements: no other concurrent work and no significant outstanding branches
  Time estimate: 40

Compile Warnings (weak depends on refactoring)
  Goal: have no compile warnings on any of our supported platforms and add -Werror (turning warnings into errors)
  Dependency: this would be easiest right after refactoring, but could be done at any time
  Time estimate: 40

Debian Package (depends on refactoring)
  Package OpenSSL+3779: 8
  Package cryptlib: 8
  Make package: 8

NAME
         dump_smart - converts ASN.1-encoded file to a more readable form

SYNOPSIS   

         dump_smart filename

DESCRIPTION
 
        This program translates the contents of the file "filename" into more
        readable form and outputs the result to stdout.  The type of file is
        determined by the suffix in "filename", which must be one of ".cer" 
        for a certificate, ".crl for a CRL, ".man" for a manifest, ".roa"
        for a ROA, or ".rta" for a RPKI TA.

        If there is no error, the translated contents of the file are printed 
        out on stdout in the readable form.  If there is an error, one of these
        messages is printed on stderr: 
 
          Usage: name of input file
          Suffix is missing
          Unknown type ...
          Error reading at ...

       where the ellipsis is replaced with specific information.  For the 
       "Unknown type" error it is the suffix.  For the "Error reading at"
       error it is a sequence of dot-separated numbers indicating where the
       error was found, e.g. 1.2.3.4 means in the fourth member of the third 
       member of the second member of the first member of the ASN.1 encoding.

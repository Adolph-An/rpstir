NAME

        make_roa - makes a ROA

SYNOPSIS
  
        make_roa  -r roadatafile -c certfile -k keyfile -o outfile

        make_roa parameterfile

DESCRIPTION

          This program creates a ROA from these parameters supplied:

            -r roadatafile where roadatafile is he name of a file containing
               data for the roa in text form, including AS#, IPv4 prefixes
               and IPv6 prefixes in the format created by the read_roa
               program (q.v).

            -c certfile where certfile is the name of the file containing
               the certificate of the entity that will sign the ROA

            -k keyfile where keyfile is the name of a file containing the 
               private key to be used for signing the ROA.

            -o outfile where outfile is the name of the file to which the ROA
               is to be written

        The parameters may be in any order.  

            As an alternative, the program may be run with a single parameter
        naming a file which contains the above-named parameters separated by 
        white space, e.g. the file might contain:

                -c mycertificate -k mykey -o some.roa -r roa.txt

            When the program completes successfully, it ends with the message

                 Created xxx

        If there is any error, the program terminates with one of several 
        messages:

          Missing xxx 
          invalid parameter yyy
          Couldn't open filename
          Error reading filename
          Error signing with filename
          Error writing wilename
  
        where xxx is the name of a parameter, yyy is a parameter given, and
        filename is the name of a file in the parameter list.

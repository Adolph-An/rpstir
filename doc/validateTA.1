NAME
        validateTA - validates a CMS structure and optionally extracts the Trust
              Anchor

SYNOPSIS   

        validateTA CMSfile ETAcert [TAcert]

DESCRIPTION
 
        The parameter CMSfile is the name of a file containing a CMS structure 
        containing a trust anchor, in accordance with the document draft-ietf-
        sidr-ta-02.  The parameter signercert is the name of a file contain-
        ing the certificate of the signer of the certificate in the CMSfile, 
        the "ETA CA certificate" in that document.  The parameter TAcert is 
        the name of the file where the certificate embedded in the CMSfile,
        called the "RTA CA certificate" will be put.

        The program checks the structure of the CMSfile, validates the signature
        of the end-entity certificate inside the CMS file using the public key 
        in the signercert file, validates the signature in the CMSfile using 
        the public key of the end entity certificate in the CMSfile (the "ETA
        EE certificate"), and validates the self-signed signature of the trust 
        anchor within the CMSfile (the "RTA CA certificate").  If all tests are
        successful, and if the TAcert parameter is present, the program extracts
        the trust anchor certificate from the CMS structure and writes it to the
        TAcert file.

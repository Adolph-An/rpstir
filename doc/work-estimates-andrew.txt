ASN.1
  Look at other libraries and determine their usability (do this before schema): 24
  If there's a good candidate library
    Possibly do this before schema
      Activate new library (to use both old and new libraries): 8

    For each function that uses ASN.1
      Modify function, using conversion function when calling unmodified subroutines: 160

Key Rollover (depends on Testbed)
  Test:  4
  Fixes: 24

Algorithm Agility, 1st Phase (targetting RSA-1024/MD5 but supporting only existing algorithms, depends on config)
  Make repo with both old and "new" algorithms: 40
  Add config item for list of algorithms to silently ignore: 16
  Test: 40

OpenSSL / Cryptlib (depends on schema)
  Reduce dependencies on OpenSSL as part of DB schema implementation. (no estimate needed)

Refactoring (exlusive)
  Goal: installable software, reduce code duplication, uniform style
  Requirements: no other concurrent work and no significant outstanding branches
  Time estimate: 64

Compile Warnings (weak depends on refactoring)
  Goal: have no compile warnings on any of our supported platforms and add -Werror (turning warnings into errors)
  Dependency: this would be easiest right after refactoring, but could be done at any time
  Time estimate: 16

Debian Package (depends on refactoring)
  Package OpenSSL+3779: 16
  Package cryptlib: 16
  Make package: 8

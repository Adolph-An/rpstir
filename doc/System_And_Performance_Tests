This document provides a summary of the goals and results of the
system and performance tests as of 2007-06-21.  Instructions on how
to execute the tests and the outputs from the tests are contained
in the directories testing (for system testing) and performance
(for performance testing).

1.0 System Tests

This is a sequence of tests designed to exercise different functionality
of the system in situations for which it is easy to tell whether the results
are as expected.  The data for the tests are
- Tests 1-6: There are 8 certs and 1 crl.  One of the certs (call it C1)
  is a trust anchor, one (C2) is a child of C1, and six (C3-C8) are
  children of C2.  The crl is a child of C2.  Until July 31, 2007, all
  the certificates will be valid, and the signatures should validate.
  The crl revokes three of the six low-level certs (C6-C8).  The crl
  is expired.
- Test 7: A roa is added.
- Test 8: The two objects are the roa and the cert that signed the roa.
  Unfortunately, the cert is not self-signed, nor do we have the cert
  that signed it.

1.1 Test 1

This test examines the ability of certs and crls to be verfied and crls to
revoke certs in the process of loading these objects into the database.
The test contains a cert (C3) that arrives out of order, loaded prior
to its parent (C2).  It also contains two certs (C6-C7) that arrive
prior to the crl that revokes them and one crl that arrives afterwards.

The outputs verify that five certs made it into the database and are
considered valid using the query.

1.2 Test 2

This test examines the ability of garbage collection to set the validity
flags of certs to be unknown when the corresponding crl is expired.
The three low-level certs still in the database (C3-C5) should be
set to unknown state by the garbage collector.  The query should handle
these three certs depending on the command-line switch.

The outputs verify that the three certs were set to unknown and had
their results written to the file unknown.out by the query when so
specified on the command line.

1.3 Test 3

This test examines the ability to unset the unknown state flags
when the associated crl is no longer expired.  For this test,
the next_update field of the crl is changed by directly manipulating
the database, but in reality a new crl would arrive with a different
expiration date.  After the garbage collection is run, the states
should no longer be unknown.

The outputs verfiy that all five certs are now fully valid.

1.4 Test 4

This test verifies that deleting a high-level cert causes all its
descendants to become invalid.  Conversely, re-adding the cert
causes validity to propage to its descendants.  The trust anchor (C1)
is the cert that is deleted and then re-added.

The outputs verify that after deletion of C1 the four remaining certs
are all invalid.  After re-adding C1, all five certs are once again valid.

1.5 Test 5

This test verifies that garbage collection expires certs whose expiration
date has passed and propagates invalidity to all its descendants.
The trust anchor (C1) has its expiration date changed in the database
directly, and then the garbage collection is run.

The outputs verify that there are only four remaining certs, all of which
are invalid.

1.6 Test 6

This test verifies that when a crl has its verification delayed due to
a trust anchor chain not existing when it first arrives, once it is
verified it revokes all certs that have arrived prior to its verification.
The database is cleared of certs and crls, and they are all reloaded,
this time in an order such that C2 is the last object loaded, so
nothing can be done until after this last cert is loaded.

The results show that there are five valid certs in the database.

1.7 Test 7

This test verifies certain roa functionality, including garbage
collection setting a roa's state to unknown and back again, the
comprehensive query printing out filter entries, and roas being
invalidated due to the trust chain being broken.  The roa is loaded
into the database, its state is changed to valid, and the ski of
cert C5 is changed to be the same ski as that of the roa.
Garbage collection is run, which should set the roa's state to unknown
because cert C5 is also unknown.  The comprehensive query is run,
with unknown going to the file unknown.out.  The expiration date on the
crl is changed so the crl is not expired and garbage collection rerun,
with another query afterwards that should indicate that the roa is now
fully valid.  The cert C5 is deleted from the database, which should
invalidate the roa, and another set of queries is run.

The results show the expected behaviors happening.

1.8 Test 8

This test shows that roas are validated whether they arrive in order
or out of order.  Because the cert that signed the roa does not have
a trust chain, we have to modify the code to do the test.  We make it
so that the results of the verification test for the cert is always
true and hence the cert is always verified.  We try the test both
when loading the cert and then the roa, and when loading the roa
before the cert.  In both cases, the roa should be validated.

The results show that the roa is valid in both cases.

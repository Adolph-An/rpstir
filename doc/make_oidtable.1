MAKE_OIDTABLE (1)             ROA-PKI                              MAKE_OIDTABLE(1)                                     

NAME

        make_oidtable -- makes a table of OIDs

SYNOPSIS
  
        make_oidtable table_name file.h ...

DESCRIPTION

            This program makes a table of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs and their more
        understandable labels which the "dump" program (cg/tools/dump) and 
        the dump facility within the casn library (cg/casn/casn_dump.c) can 
        use to make the display of object identifiers more comprehensible.

        To make the table, go to cg/asn and do:

          make_oidtable oidtable *.h

        This creates a sorted table of all the identifiers and their labels.

            To make use of this table, set your environment variable thus:

          export OIDTABLE=$HOME/apki/trunk/cg/asn/oidtable

        Then whenever you run the dump program with the -a option, it will
        label every object identifier that it recognizes like this:

             seq oid 2.5.29.14 /* id_subjectKeyIdentifier */

        The same thing will happen if you use the dump capability within
        the casn library.  See various ".raw" files in apki/trunk/testcases.

NAME

        read_roa - extracts the RouteOriginAttestation data from a ROA and 
                   converts it to readable form 

SYNOPSIS
  
        read_roa  roafile [outfile]

DESCRIPTION

            This program (in the roa-utils directory) extracts the 
        RouteOriginAttestation data from the file specified by roafile and 
        converts to the following format:

            AS# nn
            IPv4
              v4prefixes
                 :
            IPv6
              v6prefixes
                 :

        where nn is a decimal number, v4prefixes is one or more IPv4 prefixes
        in a column, and v6prefixes is one or more IPv6 prefixes in a column.
        The prefixes are in the form defined in RFC3779 with an optional
        '^xx' appended to indicate a maximum length.

            If outfile is not specified, the output is written to stdout, 
        otherwise it is written to the file specified by outfile.

        If there is any error, the program terminates with one of several messages:

          Missing xxx 
          Can't open filename
          Error reading filename
  
        where xxx is the name of a parameter, and filename is the name of a file 
        in the parameter list.

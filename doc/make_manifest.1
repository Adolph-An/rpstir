MAKE_MANIFEST (1)           MANIFEST-PKI                                 MAKE_MANIFEST(1)                                     

NAME

        make_manifest - makes a manifest

SYNOPSIS
  
        make_manifest  outfile certfile keyfile [directory]

DESCRIPTION

          This program (in the roa-utils directory) creates a manifest from the 
          parameters supplied plus information supplied at run time:

            outfile is the name of the file where the manifest is to go

            certfile is the name of the file containing the certificate to be
              put in the manifest

            keyfile is the name of the file containing the key for signing the
              manifest

            directory is the name of the directory in which the files to be 
              mentioned in the manifest are located.  The default is the current 
              directory 

          When the program runs, it first asks for a manifest number and then 
          for the starting and ending dates.  After that it asks for the names 
          of files to put in the manifest.  A null name ends the list,  If a 
          name given begins with a hyphen, the program treats the rest of the 
          name as the name of a file containing the names of files to put in 
          the manifest.  Finally it asks if you want a more human-readable 
          version of the file.  A null answer skips that step.
   
          When the program completes successfully, it ends with the message

                 Finished OK

        If there is any error, the program terminates with one of several 
        messages:
  
            Couldn't open xxx
            Error reading xxx
            Error adding xxx
            Error inserting xxx
            Error in yyy creating signature
            Error writing xxx
            File name xxx is too long
  
        where xxx is the name of a file and yyy is a step in signature creation.

          This program (in the roa-utils directory) creates a manifest from the

            outfile is the name of the file where the manifest is to go

            certfile is the name of the file containing the certificate to be
              put in the manifest

            keyfile is the name of the file containing the key for signing the
              manifest

            directory is the name of the directory directory in which the 
              files to be mentioned in the manifest are located.  The 
              default is the current directory 

          When the program runs, it asks for the names of files to put in the 
          manifest.  A null name ends the list,  If a name given begins with 
          a hyphen, the program treats the rest of the name as the name of a 
          file containing the names of files to put in the manifest.
   
          When the program completes successfully, it ends with the message

                 Finished OK

        If there is any error, the program terminates with one of several 
        messages:
  
            Couldn't open xxx
            Error reading xxx
            Error adding xxx
            Error inserting xxx

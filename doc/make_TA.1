NAME
        make_TA - constructs a CMS structure to hold an EE certificate and a
              self-signed RTA certificate, and signs it.

SYNOPSIS   

        make_TA ETAcertificate EEcertificate RTAcertificate EEkeyfile outfile

DESCRIPTION
    
        The files specified in the first four parameters are read, checked,
        assembled into the CMS structure, and signed.  The parameters are as 
        follows: ETAcertificate is the name of the file containing the ETA's 
        certificate, EEcertificate is the name of the file containing the EE 
        certificate, RTAcertificate is the name of the file containing the RTA 
        certificate, EEkeyfile is the name of ".p15" file containing the key 
        material for the EE, and outfile is the name of the file where the 
        resulting CMS structure will be put.  In addition, the program produces
        a more readable version of the contents of outfile in a file of the 
        same name but suffixed with ".raw".
